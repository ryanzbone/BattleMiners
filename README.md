# Battle Miners In Space

## Current Plan

1v1 indirect combat
Destroy central asteroid to create debris
Use implosion/explosions to direct debris towards opponent
Either health bar or some kind of limit to the amount of hits you can take in a limited time which would lead towards trying to score big crunches on the opponents
Might be interesting to have to charge your shots, the more they're charged, the bigger the radius for implosion or explosion.
